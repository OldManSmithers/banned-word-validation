# Banned Word and Pattern Service

![banned word image](./bannedWord.jpg)

Getting Angular's custom validation to play nicely has always been a chore, so I usually handle it through a service.  Simple to modify and use however you like.  The service comes preloaded with a banned word list *trigger warning* which was also surprisingly hard to find online.  

Hope it helps.
